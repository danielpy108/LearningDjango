# Learning Django

With this note taking web app I'm going to code everything that I'll be learning about Django, HTML, CSS and even vue.js as front-end framework. 

As the time goes on, I'll be improving the way this site looks and the way the backend works by adding a better database (postgresql).

I know the front-end is shitty but over time as I learn more concepts about css.

The site, currently look like this:
